Welcome to the Electron Cash documentation!
===========================================

**SECURITY ALERT: Electron Cash version 3.1.2 has been released. A JSONRPC security hole was discovered that affects all Electrum forks. This has been fully patched in Electron Cash 3.1.2. If you were running a prior version as an online wallet without a strong password, you should consider the wallet compromised and create a fresh wallet with version 3.1.2 or better.**

Electron Cash is a lightweight Bitcoin Cash wallet.

Current versions are:

- Windows, Mac, and Linux - 4.0.6
- Android - 3.3.5

Electron Cash can be downloaded from https://electroncash.org/ or the `PlayStore <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.electroncash.electroncash3>`_. These are the *only* authentic sources.
